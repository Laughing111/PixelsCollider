|This is a free asset package. If you paid for this, you got ripped off.|


This package includes the following:

     - 4 Prefabs |Rigged and Not Rigged|
    
     - Basic Player Script to test the animations
 
     - Misc Demo Environment

In the Demo Scene, you can mess around with the rigged character to preview the animations. Use the Arrow Keys or A and D to move, Left Alt to attack, Space to jump, Z to play dead animation, and X to switch characters. 
There are two characters; a basic no weapon character, and one with a bat. The bat character has 2 Attack animations, the basic character has only 1.

Thank you again for downloading! If you have any questions or comments, my information's below.
